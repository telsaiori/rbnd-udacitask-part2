# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?
'table_print'
I use it to displayed the filtered items.

  a) Feature 1... Allow deletion of multiple items
  b) Feature 2... Change the priority levels of items

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
About 6 hours.

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
I found that I misunderstanding some basic logic like "return" and "or".
I got stuck on the raise UdaciListErrors::InvalidPriorityValue if options[:priority] != "high" || options[:priority] != "medium" || options[:priority] != "low"
and then I realize that it evaluates the whole thing to true and doesnâ€™t even bother checking the rest of it when it hit the true.

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
  a) Feature 1... Allow deletion of multiple items
  b) Feature 2... Change the priority levels of items
Sadly I think I don't know how to write other new features.

4. Where do you still have room to grow?
I still feel confused to handle the object. I need to print the instance all the time to check what kind of data in it.
And not only use "each" to handle the array I also try to use other method like map,select....
